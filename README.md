# Sales-insights-Data-analysis-project
This project has the sales insights of a company which sells computer hardware and other accessories. I have used MySQL for performing Data analysis, then imported the data from there to PowerBI for Data transformation and data visualization & report making/dashboarding

SQL database dump is in db_dump.sql file above. Once can download the db_dump.sql file.

Get a glimpse of the dashboard through the snap taken below
